  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <div>
    This course provides an introduction to web design and development with a
    key focus on digital archives, materiality, information visualization, and
    user interaction. Through a project-based approach, students will apply
    design and interaction principles to create their own scholarly archive. We
    will explore how digital collections are created, modified, and preserved.
    Students will discuss readings by scholars such as Johanna Drucker, Wendy
    Hui Kyong Chun, and Sue Breakell, while engaging in hands-on collection and
    design practices. From a technical perspective, students will gain a
    fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and walk away with
    their own digital archive.

  <h3>A Note on Privacy and the Web</h3>
  <div>
    You will create websites in this course. These sites, by default, will be
    publicly accessible online; they will enter the "web" that is the web . This
    is great! But it also comes with additional responsibilities. Be mindful
    about the material you share (e.g. do not republish in-copyright material)
    and be particularly cautious about any personally identifiable information
    you put online (your own and especially others'). See NYU's FERPA guidelines
    for additional information. If you have concerns about privacy or public
    access to your site, please contact me to discuss accommodations.

  <h3>Syllabus Version Control</h3>
  <div>
    This syllabus will be updated over the course of the semester. The most
    recent version can be found here.

<section>
  <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
  <div>
    You are expected to attend all class sessions. Excused absences are only
    allowed for special circumstances such as emergencies or illness. Notify me
    in advance if an excused absence is necessary. Each unexcused absence will
    deduct 5% from your final grade. If you have three or more unexcused
    absences, you risk failing the course.
    <br />
    Be on time to class. If you are more than fifteen minutes late, or if you
    leave early (without my clearance), it will count as an unexcused absence.
