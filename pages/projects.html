  <h3 style="margin: 0">P1: Digital Translation</h3>
  <div>Due Week 6, Feb 27</div>
  <br />
  <div>
    In this project, you will select a static and/or physical item (such as a
    printed text, image, document, sculpture, or physical object) and translate
    it into a digital format. The goal is to explore how digital tools can alter
    the way we interact with, interpret, and present physical items.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Assignment Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Explore the creative process of translating analog (physical) forms into
        digital formats.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the impact of digital media on the meaning and form of the
        chosen item.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply digital technologies such as HTML, CSS, image editing, or other
        tools at your disposal to reimagine your chosen item in a digital
        environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reflect on the potential loss, transformation, or amplification of
        meaning in the digital translation process.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <li>
      Final Digital Translation: A fully digital representation of your chosen
      physical item using only HTML and CSS. This could be a webpage, an image
      gallery, or a text-based project presented in a digital format.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reflection Paper (500-750 words): A reflection on the process of
      translating the item into a digital form. Your paper should address: The
      original item (what it is, where it’s from, its context, and why you chose
      it). The translation process (tools you used, challenges you faced, and
      decisions made along the way). The impact of digital translation (how the
      digital version changes the meaning, accessibility, or perception of the
      original item). A comparison of the analog vs. digital experience (What is
      gained or lost in the translation? How does digital media amplify or
      change the original?).
    </li>
    <li>
      You will submit both of these via a GitHub repository. You may name this
      repo whatever you'd like. Please ensure it contains both the website and
      the reflection. Submit here.
    </li>
