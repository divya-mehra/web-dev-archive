  <h3 style="margin: 0">P2: Visual Collection</h3>
  <div><del>Due Week 10, Apr 3</del></div>
  <div><del>Due Apr 8 11:59 PM ET</del></div>
  <br />
  <div>
    In this project, you will create a visual collection of related items,
    considering how they are categorized, described, and contextualized in a
    digital space. Your collection can focus on anything, but should be
    structured with intentional metadata and organizational logic. It may be as
    practical or impractical as you’d like. It may be esoteric, speculative,
    historical, or personal. What matters is that you have a clear justification
    for your method.
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    The goal is to think critically about curation, classification, and the
    relationships between different elements. How do digital collections shape
    meaning? What does metadata reveal or obscure? Additionally, this is an
    opportunity to put your JavaScript learnings into practice.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Assignment Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Curate a collection of at least 10-15 items with metadata.
      </li>
      <li>Explore how classification systems impact interpretation.</li>
      <li>Structure the collection using JSON or an object for data organization.</li>
      <li>
        Build a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the
        collection.
      </li>
      <li>Provide an index and/or filtering interface (search is optional — we haven't yet covered this).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Visual Collection:</strong> A front-end interface with a
        collection of at least 10-15 items, including categories and other
        metadata, that can be viewed and filtered in different ways.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflection Paper (500+ words): </strong>Think about: Why this
        collection? How did you make decisions regarding what to include and
        what not to include? How does structuring and classifying the collection
        affect interpretation? How did you make your design decisions and how do
        these affect the process of navigation and discovery? How does the
        inclusion of JavaScript affect the digital experience?

  <h3 style="margin: 0">P1: Digital Translation</h3>
  <div>Due Week 6, Feb 27</div>
  <br />
  <div>
    In this project, you will select a static and/or physical item (such as a
    printed text, image, document, sculpture, or physical object) and translate
    it into a digital format. The goal is to explore how digital tools can alter
    the way we interact with, interpret, and present physical items.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Assignment Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Explore the creative process of translating analog (physical) forms into
        digital formats.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the impact of digital media on the meaning and form of the
        chosen item.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply digital technologies such as HTML, CSS, image editing, or other
        tools at your disposal to reimagine your chosen item in a digital
        environment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Digital Translation:</strong> A fully digital
        representation of your chosen physical item using HTML and CSS.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflection Paper (500-750 words): </strong>A reflection on the
        process of translating the item into a digital form. Your paper should
        address: The original item (what it is, where it’s from, its context,
        and why you chose it). The translation process (tools you used,
        challenges you faced, and decisions made along the way). The impact of
        digital translation (how the digital version changes the meaning,
        accessibility, or perception of the original item). A comparison of the
        analog vs. digital experience (What is gained or lost in the
        translation? How does digital media amplify or change the original?).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You will submit both of these via a GitHub repository.</strong>
        You may name this repo whatever you'd like. Please ensure it contains
        both the website and the reflection.
