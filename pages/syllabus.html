    <h4>Course Description</h4>
    <div>
      This course provides an introduction to web design and development with
      a key focus on digital archives, materiality, information visualization,
      and user interaction. Through a project-based approach, students will
      apply design and interaction principles to create their own scholarly
      archive. We will explore how digital collections are created, modified,
      and preserved. Students will discuss readings by scholars such as
      Johanna Drucker, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, and Sue Breakell, while engaging
      in hands-on collection and design practices. From a technical
      perspective, students will gain a fundamental understanding of HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript, and walk away with their own digital archive.

    <h4>A Note on Privacy and the Web</h4>
    <div>
      You will create websites in this course. These sites, by default, will
      be publicly accessible online; they will enter the "web" that is the web
      . This is great! But it also comes with additional responsibilities. Be
      mindful about the material you share (e.g. do not republish in-copyright
      material) and be particularly cautious about any personally identifiable
      information you put online (your own and especially others'). See NYU's
      FERPA guidelines for additional information. If you have concerns about
      privacy or public access to your site, please contact me to discuss
      accommodations.

    <h4>Attendance Policy</h4>
    <div>
      You are expected to attend all class sessions. Excused absences are only
      allowed for special circumstances such as emergencies or illness. Notify
      me in advance if an excused absence is necessary. Each unexcused absence
      will deduct 5% from your final grade. If you have three or more
      unexcused absences, you risk failing the course.
      <br />
      Be on time to class. If you are more than fifteen minutes late, or if
      you leave early (without my clearance), it will count as an unexcused
      absence.
